# Pinetree
OS for the same-named gaming console. We're using SDL and our code is based on https://github.com/Twinklebear/TwinklebearDev-Lessons
## How to start developing
After cloning the repo, there are some steps to do
### OSX
You have to download [the development libraries of SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.0.3.dmg) and [the development libraries of SDL_ttf](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL2_ttf-2.0.12.dmg). Copy both frameworks to your `/Library/Frameworks` folder
